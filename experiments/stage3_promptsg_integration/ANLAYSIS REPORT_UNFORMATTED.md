##  v1  Baseline PromptSG with Linear Classifier
###  Configuration Highlights:
- Model: ViT-B/16 or RN50 (based on config)
- Stage: Stage 3 (joint prompt + image encoder tuning)
- Classifier: `nn.Linear` (used after pooled multimodal features)
- Loss Functions:
  - Cross-Entropy Loss (for ID classification)
  - Triplet Loss (for feature separation)
  - SupCon Loss = 0 (disabled for this baseline)
-  Use AdamW instead of Adam
  - Better handles L2 regularization using `weight_decay`
  - Prevents weight explosion

- Prompt Embedding:
  - Pseudo-tokens learned via inversion model
  - Prompt template: `"A detailed photo of {}'s {aspect} hand for identification."`
- Prompt Fusion: Multimodal cross-attention (1 layer), followed by mean pooling
- Embedding Regularization:
  - `F.normalize()` on pooled embeddings
  - `F.dropout(p=0.1)` applied after fusion
- Optimizer: `Adam`
  - Separate LR for:
    - `clip.visual`  `0.0001`
    - All other modules  `0.00001`
- Regularization:
  - `weight_decay = 0.0005`
  - Gradient clipping: `max_norm=5.0`
- Validation:
  - Done using ReID-style cosine similarity
  - Classifier logits NOT used in validation (logits skipped)
  - Rank-1, Rank-5, Rank-10 and mAP reported

---

###  Why is this baseline useful?
- Provides a clean foundation to compare further improvements (ArcFace, SupCon, BNNeck, etc.)
- Avoids classifier interference during evaluation (important for ReID metrics)
- Learns direct similarity-driven embeddings

#### v2 abstract

This version strengthens training through:
- Better optimization dynamics
- Regularization for generalization
- Adaptive scaling of loss contributions
- Optional learning rate warm-up

---

###  Key Implementation Highlights (v2)

-  L2 Regularization via `weight_decay=1e-4` (tunable)
-  Learning Rate Warm-up (first few epochs)
  - Helps CLIP visual layers adapt gradually
-  SupCon Temperature Scaling (make `temperature` configurable)
  - Lower `temperature` sharpens positive vs negative contrast
-  Loss Weight Auto-balancing
  - Log all loss components (ID, SupCon, Triplet)
  - Adjust weights if one dominates early on
-  Cosine LR Decay with Warmup _(optional)_
-  Early Stopping Patience = 5 _(increased slightly)_

---

###  Why v2?

- We already using ArcFace + SupCon + Triplet in v1.
- However, training is unstable, especially for RN50: after epoch 4, Rank-1 fluctuates  signs of either:
  - Overfitting (too confident model)
  - Suboptimal optimization settings
- ViT-B/16 ends at 53.14% Rank-1  early stopping kicks in due to stagnation

---

(Perfect  let me walk you through implementing all 3 improvements _without needing `transformers`_, using native PyTorch or simplified logic.

---

###  2. Cosine LR Scheduler with Warmup (No Transformers)

Replace `transformers.get_cosine_schedule_with_warmup` with PyTorch's native cosine scheduler + manual warmup.

####  Step-by-step

 After `optimizer` definition:
```python
from torch.optim.lr_scheduler import CosineAnnealingLR

# total steps for cosine schedule (after warmup)
warmup_epochs = config.get("warmup_epochs", 1)
cosine_scheduler = CosineAnnealingLR(
    optimizer,
    T_max=(config["epochs"] - warmup_epochs),
    eta_min=1e-7  # final learning rate
)
```

 Inside training loop (top):
```python
if epoch <= warmup_epochs:
    warmup_factor = epoch / warmup_epochs
    for g in optimizer.param_groups:
        g['lr'] = g['initial_lr'] * warmup_factor
else:
    cosine_scheduler.step()
```

 (Optional) Log it:
```python
logger.info(f"[Epoch {epoch}] Learning rate: {optimizer.param_groups[0]['lr']:.6f}")
```

 Before optimizer setup, save initial LR:
```python
for group in optimizer.param_groups:
    group.setdefault('initial_lr', group['lr'])
```

---

###  3. Configurable SupCon Temperature

####  YAML:
Add:
```yaml
supcon_temperature: 0.07
```

####  Inside your loss init:
```python
supcon_loss_fn = SymmetricSupConLoss(temperature=config.get("supcon_temperature", 0.07))
```

 Done. The SupCon loss now uses adjustable sharpness control.

---

###  4. Adjust SupCon Weight with Epochs

If you want SupCon to gradually grow over time (like a curriculum):

####  Replace your current loss weight line:
```python
supcon_weight = config['supcon_loss_weight'] * (epoch / config['epochs'])
```

Then total loss becomes:
```python
loss = (
    config['loss_id_weight'] * id_loss +
    config['loss_tri_weight'] * triplet_loss +
    supcon_weight * supcon_loss
)
```

 This encourages the model to first focus on classification (ID + Triplet) then learn fine-grained contrast later.

---

v4: for both

Heres your updated `build_promptsg_models()` function for v4  BNNeck with optional dimension reduction:

---

###  v4: Updated Version (with comments)

```python
def build_promptsg_models(config, num_classes, device):
    #  Detect CLIP output dimension based on backbone
    model_dim_map = {
        "vitb16": 512,
        "vitb32": 512,
        "rn50": 1024,
        "rn101": 512,
        "rn50x4": 640,
        "rn50x16": 768,
        "rn50x64": 1024
    }
    clip_model_name = config["model"].lower()
    pseudo_dim = model_dim_map.get(clip_model_name, 512)  # default = 512
    transformer_layers = config['transformer_layers']

    # === PromptSG modules ===
    inversion_model = TextualInversionMLP(pseudo_dim, pseudo_dim).to(device)
    multimodal_module = MultiModalInteraction(dim=pseudo_dim, depth=transformer_layers).to(device)

    # === BNNeck (v4): Optional Reduction + BN + ArcFace ===
    use_bnneck = config.get("classifier", "linear").lower() == "arcface"
    use_reduction = config.get("bnneck_reduction", False)
    reduced_dim = config.get("bnneck_dim", 256)

    if use_bnneck:
        if use_reduction:
            reduction = nn.Linear(pseudo_dim, reduced_dim).to(device)
            feat_dim = reduced_dim
        else:
            reduction = nn.Identity().to(device)
            feat_dim = pseudo_dim

        bnneck = nn.BatchNorm1d(feat_dim).to(device)
        classifier = ArcFace(in_features=feat_dim, out_features=num_classes).to(device)

        return inversion_model, multimodal_module, reduction, bnneck, classifier
    else:
        # === Fallback to simple Linear Classifier (v1 baseline) ===
        classifier = nn.Linear(pseudo_dim, num_classes).to(device)
        return inversion_model, multimodal_module, None, None, classifier
```

---

###  Notes:
- This function now supports both `v1` (linear classifier) and `v4` (BNNeck with ArcFace).
- When using ArcFace, you must also return the `reduction` layer and `bnneck`, and apply them inside the `train()` loop:
  ```python
  features = reduction(pooled)
  features_bn = bnneck(features)
  logits = classifier(features_bn, labels)
  ```

---

###  Required YAML fields:
```yaml
classifier: arcface
bnneck_reduction: true
bnneck_dim: 256
```

vitb4: Rank-1 Accuracy : 42.25%  Rank-5 Accuracy : 68.06%  Rank-10 Accuracy: 78.82% Mean AP         : 54.32%

##  v5  for bnoth

PromptSG with Semantic Consistency & Inversion Refinement

###  Motivation:
To align more closely with the official PromptSG paper, v5 integrates architectural fidelity and semantic embedding improvements. This version strengthens the _prompt generation_ and _fusion mechanism_, guided by insights from 5.1, 5.3, and ablation studies in the paper.

> The inversion network is a lightweight model with a three-layer MLP... a BatchNorm layer is placed after the last state.

---

###  Key Enhancements in v5

####  1. TextualInversionMLP now replicates paper architecture
- 3-layer MLP with 512 hidden dimensions
- `nn.BatchNorm1d` added after the final linear layer
- ReLU activation after each hidden layer
- Output dimension matches CLIP encoder (`512` or `1024` based on model)

```python
self.mlp = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(in_dim, 512),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(512, 512),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(512, out_dim),
    nn.BatchNorm1d(out_dim)
)
```

---

####  2. Multimodal Prompt Interaction = Paper-Compliant
- `transformer_layers: 3`  1 cross-attn + 2 self-attn (as per paper)
- Cross-modal refinement using fused visual + textual embeddings
- `MultiModalInteraction` module now handles semantic attention properly

---

####  3. Composed Prompt is Used for Training + Validation
- `compose_prompt()` is used both for training and evaluation
- Template uses dynamic aspect injection:
```yaml
prompt_template: "A photo of a {} {aspect} hand."
```

 Controlled via config flag:
```yaml
use_composed_prompt: true
```

===================================
v6
for both

- changed max_norm=1.0  #  this prevents gradient explosion (from 5 to 1)  --- in v5 it was 5
- lr_clip_visual: 0.000001
- lr_modules: 0.000001

####  4. BNNeck + ArcFace Optional Head
- Inspired by CLIP-ReID and PromptSG SOTA setups
- `train_helpers.build_promptsg_models()` updated to:
  - Allow Linear classifier (v1) or
  - BNNeck + ArcFace + optional reduction (v4/v5)

Configurable via:
```yaml
classifier: arcface
bnneck_reduction: true
bnneck_dim: 256
```

---

####  5. Semantic Alignment and Efficiency Focus (Paper-Inspired)
- BN added to `TextualInversionMLP` improves alignment stability
- Training speed improved due to reduced trainable parameter growth
- Optional inference switch between:
  - full composed prompt
  - fixed template (for efficiency trade-off)

---

v7: for both

Avoid Crossentropy loss
If youre intentionally experimenting with a pure contrastive objective, thats fine.
 keep ID loss (even with low weight):
loss = (config['loss_id_weight'] * id_loss +
        config['loss_tri_weight'] * triplet_loss +
        supcon_weight * supcon_loss)

vitb16: like v6
rn50: poor performance...

======================
