Perfect — let me explain each of the files you listed under `experiments/` so you know exactly what they are for, and how they fit into your CLIP-FH workflow.

# 📁 `experiments/` — Your Central Execution Hub

This directory contains **entry-point scripts** to run different parts of your CLIP-FH system — training, evaluation, multi-run jobs.

---

### ✅ `run_eval_clip.py`
- **Purpose**: Evaluates any trained/baseline model using a YAML config.
- **Inputs**: A config from `configs/baseline/` or `configs/finetuned/`
- **Does**:
  - Loads the model (baseline or fine-tuned)
  - Loads query/gallery splits
  - Runs re-ID for `num_splits` (e.g., 10)
  - Saves results to `result_logs/`

> 💡 Ideal for single-run testing of model performance.

---

### ✅ `run_all_experiments.py`
- **Purpose**: Batch-runs all evaluation configs automatically.
- **Does**:
  - Scans all `configs/baseline/` and/or `configs/finetuned/`
  - Calls `run_eval_clip.py` for each config
  - Produces full result set in `result_logs/`

> 💡 Run this when you want to benchmark all models and datasets at once.

---

### ✅ `train_finetune_clip.py`
- **Purpose**: Fine-tunes the CLIP image encoder with frozen text encoder.
- **Loads config from**: `configs/train_finetune/`
- **Does**:
  - Loads base CLIP model (ViT-B/16 or RN50)
  - Freezes the text encoder
  - Adds a classifier head (e.g., ArcFace or softmax)
  - Trains on 11k/HD datasets
  - Saves models to `saved_models/`

> 💡 This is your go-to script for standard finetuning of image encoder only.

---

### ✅ `train_clipreid_stage1.py`
- **Purpose**: Stage 1 of CLIP-ReID training — learn prompt tokens.
- **Loads config from**: `configs/train_clipreid/`
- **Does**:
  - Freezes both image and text encoders
  - Adds learnable text tokens (prompt tuning)
  - Uses image–text contrastive loss
  - Saves learned tokens for Stage 2

> 💡 Needed if you're implementing the two-stage CLIP-ReID strategy.

---

### ✅ `train_clipreid_stage2.py`
- **Purpose**: Stage 2 of CLIP-ReID — finetune image encoder with learned tokens.
- **Loads config from**: `configs/train_clipreid/`
- **Does**:
  - Loads text tokens from Stage 1
  - Freezes text encoder and prompts
  - Trains image encoder (CE loss + triplet + contrastive)
  - Saves image encoder weights

> 💡 This completes the two-stage CLIP-ReID training.

---

### ✅ `train_full_finetune.py`
- **Purpose**: Fully finetunes both the CLIP text encoder and image encoder.
- **Loads config from**: `configs/train_finetune_full/`
- **Does**:
  - Unfreezes all parameters in CLIP
  - Applies joint optimization (optional classifier head)
  - Saves checkpoint

> 💡 Use this when you want to tune the entire CLIP model.

---

### ✅ `__init__.py`
- Empty or utility file so the `experiments/` folder can be imported as a Python module.
- Not required unless you're structuring this as an importable package.

✅ Let me know if you want me to generate templates for any of these scripts — e.g., a full version of `train_finetune_clip.py` with CLI + config loading + training loop.
