# ✅ HandCLIP Fine-Tuning: Complete Basic Implementation Plan  
---

## ✅ Step 1: Dataset Preparation  
📌 **Why This Step Matters**  
- Prepares the **train**, **val**, and **test** sets, ensuring **structured learning and evaluation**.  
- Enables **query-gallery evaluation**, essential for **Re-ID tasks**.

🎯 **What You Need To Do**  
- Use **train**, **val**, and **test** folders for Dorsal/Palmar Right and Left hands.  
- Each split includes **images sorted by identity**.

✅ **Mandatory**  
- You’ve already **completed** this step!

---

## ✅ Step 2: Create PyTorch Dataset and DataLoader  
📌 **Why This Step Matters**  
- Efficiently loads **images and labels** in batches.  
- Dataloaders handle **shuffling** and **batching**, essential for stable training.

🎯 **What You Need To Do**  
- Implement a **PyTorch Dataset class** to:  
  ➡️ Load **images** and their **identity labels**  
  ➡️ Apply **CLIP’s preprocess transforms**  
- Use PyTorch **DataLoader** for:  
  ➡️ **Batching** the data  
  ➡️ **Shuffling** during training  

✅ **Mandatory**  
- Augmentations are skipped in this plan to keep it **minimal and focused**.  
- Only use **CLIP’s default preprocessing pipeline**.

---

## ✅ Step 3: Load the Pre-trained CLIP Model  
📌 **Why This Step Matters**  
- Leverages CLIP’s **pre-trained knowledge** on large-scale datasets.  
- Forms the **base model** for fine-tuning on **hand-specific data**.

🎯 **What You Need To Do**  
- Load **ViT-B/32** (or similar) CLIP model.  
- Load **both image and text encoders**, even if the focus is on **image-only** classification.

✅ **Mandatory**  
- For this plan, we **fine-tune the image encoder only**.  
- The **text encoder** is not used because **no text prompts** are involved.  
- Freeze/unfreeze decisions are **predefined**:  
  ➡️ Unfreeze the **image encoder**.  
  ➡️ Keep the **text encoder frozen** or unused.

---

## ✅ Step 4: Skip Text Prompts (No Contrastive Learning)  
📌 **Why This Step Matters**  
- We are focusing on **image-only** classification.  
- Eliminates the **need for text prompts** and **text encoder** fine-tuning.

🎯 **What You Need To Do**  
- Prepare **identity labels** for classification tasks.  
- Ignore **text embeddings**.

✅ **Mandatory Decision**  
- No **text prompts** are used in this implementation.  
- Focus on **classification loss** instead.

---

## ✅ Step 5: Choose Classification Loss (Cross-Entropy)  
📌 **Why This Step Matters**  
- Guides the model to **predict the correct identity** for each hand image.  
- Standard for **supervised classification tasks**.

🎯 **What You Need To Do**  
- Use **Cross-Entropy Loss** as the objective function.  
- Pass **image embeddings** through a **classification head** (e.g., fully connected layer) mapping to the **number of identities**.

✅ **Mandatory**  
- **No contrastive loss**.  
- Use **Cross-Entropy Loss** directly on the classifier output.

---

## ✅ Step 6: Define Optimizer and Learning Rate  
📌 **Why This Step Matters**  
- Ensures **stable fine-tuning** of the pre-trained CLIP model.  
- Controls the **speed and stability** of learning.

🎯 **What You Need To Do**  
- Use **AdamW** optimizer  
- Set **learning rate** between **1e-5 and 1e-6**  
- Weight decay: **0.01**  
- **No learning rate scheduler** (keeping it simple for mandatory flow).

✅ **Mandatory**  
- Optimizer: `AdamW`  
- Learning Rate: `1e-5`  
- No scheduler.

---

## ✅ Step 7: Training Loop  
📌 **Why This Step Matters**  
- Executes the actual **learning process**, adapting CLIP to **hand image features**.

🎯 **What You Need To Do (Per Epoch)**  
1. **Forward Pass**  
   - Encode image features  
   - Pass through the classification head  
2. **Compute Cross-Entropy Loss**  
3. **Backward Pass + Optimizer Step**  
   - Update model weights  
4. **Validation Pass After Each Epoch**  
   - Compute **validation loss** and **Rank-1 Accuracy**  
5. **Save Best Model**  
   - Save weights if validation improves  
   - No early stopping—run for **fixed number of epochs** (e.g., 50 epochs)

✅ **Mandatory**  
- Forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation, validation, and checkpointing.  
- Regular validation to monitor overfitting.  
- Save the **best performing model**.

---

## ✅ Step 8: Evaluation on Query and Gallery  
📌 **Why This Step Matters**  
- Measures **how well** HandCLIP performs in **Re-ID tasks**.  
- Directly assesses the model’s **practical application** in identity verification.

🎯 **What You Need To Do**  
- Evaluate on the **test set** with **query and gallery** splits prepared earlier.  
- Compute:  
  ➡️ **Rank-1 Accuracy**  
  ➡️ **Mean Average Precision (mAP)**  
- Use the **embeddings from the fine-tuned model** for comparison.  
- Perform **similarity search** (e.g., cosine similarity) between **query** and **gallery** embeddings.

✅ **Mandatory**  
- Compute **Rank-1 Accuracy** and **mAP** for evaluation.  
- No CMC curves or extra visualization.

---

## ✅ Step 9: Compare Fine-Tuned HandCLIP vs Baseline CLIP  
📌 **Why This Step Matters**  
- **Validates improvements** after fine-tuning.  
- Provides **quantitative evidence** of success.

🎯 **What You Need To Do**  
- Compare metrics from:  
  ➡️ **Baseline CLIP** (zero-shot) evaluation  
  ➡️ **Fine-Tuned HandCLIP** evaluation  
- Analyze improvements in **Rank-1 Accuracy** and **mAP**.

✅ **Mandatory**  
- Comparison and basic reporting (tables of scores).  
- No advanced error analysis.
