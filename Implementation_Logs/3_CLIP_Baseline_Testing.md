## ✅ Step 2: Baseline CLIP Evaluation (Without Fine-tuning)

### 👉 What is this step?
You will test the **original CLIP model (ViT-B/32)** on your **hand dataset**, without making any changes or fine-tuning.

---

### 👉 Why do this step?
- You need a **starting point** to see how well CLIP works before you fine-tune it.
- Helps you compare later and show how much fine-tuning improves performance.
- You will check if CLIP can **match hand images to the correct identity** just from its **pre-trained knowledge**.

---

## 🪜 Sub-steps (Simple and Clear)

---

### **Step 1: Load CLIP Model**
- Use the **CLIP library** from OpenAI (or Hugging Face).  
- Load the **ViT-B/32** model (it’s smaller and faster for experiments).  
- Also load the **CLIP tokenizer**, though you only need the image encoder here.

✅ Example:  
```python
import clip  
model, preprocess = clip.load("ViT-B/32")  
```

---

### **Step 2: Extract Image Features (Embeddings)**
You will extract **feature vectors** (embeddings) for:
- **Gallery images** → Stored as your **search database**  
- **Query images** → Images you want to search/match  

✅ What you do:  
- Preprocess each image (resize, normalize).  
- Pass it through CLIP’s **image encoder** to get the **512-dimension feature vector**.

✅ Example:  
```python
image = preprocess(pil_image).unsqueeze(0)  
with torch.no_grad():  
    image_features = model.encode_image(image)  
```

---

### **Step 3: Compute Similarity Between Query and Gallery**
- For each **query image**, compare its embedding to **every gallery image embedding**.
- Use **cosine similarity** to measure how similar they are.

✅ What happens:  
- If a query and gallery image are from the **same person (same identity)**, the similarity score should be high.

✅ Example:  
```python
import torch.nn.functional as F  
similarity = F.cosine_similarity(query_embedding, gallery_embeddings)
```

---

### **Step 4: Rank the Gallery Images**
- For each query, sort the gallery images by **similarity score (highest to lowest)**.  
- The **top result** should be the correct match (ideally).

✅ Example:  
- Query image → Matches gallery images → Highest score is **Rank-1 prediction**.

---

### **Step 5: Evaluate the Results**
- Measure **how often** the correct identity is ranked **first** (**Rank-1 accuracy**).  
- Calculate **mAP (Mean Average Precision)** to measure overall ranking quality.

✅ Metrics:
- **Rank-1 Accuracy**: Did the correct person appear at the top?  
- **mAP**: How good is the full ranking list? (more detailed performance measure)

---

### **Bonus: Repeat for All Queries**
- Repeat this for **all queries** and **average the scores**.  
- The results tell you how well CLIP works **without fine-tuning**.

---

## 📝 Example in Your Project Context
- Query Image: **"Person A - Dorsal Right Hand"**  
- Gallery: All known hand images (multiple people).  
- CLIP ranks Person A’s matching image at the **top position** → Correct match!  
✅ This shows **zero-shot** hand re-identification power.
