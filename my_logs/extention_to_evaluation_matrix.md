# Extension to Evaluation
```python
sim_matrix = compute_similarity_matrix(query_feats, gallery_feats)
metrics = evaluate_rank(sim_matrix, query_labels, gallery_labels)
```

This tells me you're using a **pairwise similarity matrix** between query and gallery, along with the **true identity labels** for both.

### ✅ So What’s Already Available?

You already have:
- **Similarity matrix**: `[N_query, N_gallery]` of cosine similarity scores.
- **Query labels**: `[N_query]`, the ground truth identities.
- **Gallery labels**: `[N_gallery]`, the true identities for each gallery image.

This means you already have everything needed to compute the **core and extended ReID metrics**.

### 🧩 What Can You Calculate With What You Have?

| Metric                  | Already Implemented? | Requires Additional Info? | Notes |
|-------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|-------|
| **Rank-k (Rank-1, 5, 10)** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | You’re already doing this |
| **mAP**                 | ✅ Yes | ❌ No | Already included |
| **CMC Curve**           | ✅ (partially) | ❌ No | You can plot full CMC from the same rank-k data |
| **Precision@k**         | ❌ Not shown | ❌ No | Needs same sim_matrix + labels |
| **Recall@k**            | ❌ Not shown | ❌ No | Same as above |
| **F1@k**                | ❌ Not shown | ❌ No | Derived from precision and recall |
| **nDCG@k**              | ❌ Not shown | ❌ No | Can compute from sim_matrix + labels |
| **ROC / AUC**           | ❌ Not shown | ❌ No | Just need sim scores + match/non-match labels |
| **Confusion Matrix**    | ❌ Not shown | ❌ No | Just take top-1 index from each row |
| **Per-class Accuracy**  | ❌ Not shown | ❌ No | Group predictions and compute stats per identity |

### 🧪 Summary: What You Already Have in Your Pipeline

You **already have all the inputs** required to compute any of the following:

- Precision@k
- Recall@k
- F1@k
- nDCG@k
- CMC full curve
- ROC / AUC
- Confusion Matrix
- Class-wise evaluation (mean, worst-case)

You do **not need any new labels, model outputs, or dataset structure**.  
All you need to do is **add post-processing** over the existing `sim_matrix`, `query_labels`, and `gallery_labels`.
